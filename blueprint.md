# Blueprint: My Personal Website

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and implementation plan for a personal website. The goal is to create a modern, visually appealing, and responsive website that showcases my portfolio and skills.

## Design and Style

*   **Aesthetics:** Clean, modern, and professional.
*   **Color Palette:** A mix of dark and light colors to create a bold and energetic feel.
*   **Typography:** Expressive fonts to emphasize key information.
*   **Layout:** A responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Interactivity:** Smooth animations and interactive elements to engage users.
*   **Parallax Scrolling:** Use of fixed background images with scrolling content to create a sense of depth and immersion.

## Current Plan

*   **Enhance Visuals:** Add city-themed background images to each section of the website to provide clearer visual separation. The background images will be fixed to create a parallax effect as the user scrolls.
