# Blueprint: My Personal Website

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and implementation plan for a personal website. The goal is to create a modern, visually appealing, and responsive website that showcases my portfolio and skills.

## Design and Style

*   **Aesthetics:** Clean, modern, and professional.
*   **Color Palette:** A mix of dark and light colors to create a bold and energetic feel. The key color is #F19A88.
*   **Typography:** Expressive fonts to emphasize key information.
*   **Layout:** A responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Interactivity:** Smooth animations and interactive elements to engage users.
*   **Parallax Scrolling:** Use of fixed background images with scrolling content to create a sense of depth and immersion.

## Current Plan

*   **Contact Me Section:** Improved the design of the "Contact Me" section for a cleaner and more modern look. Fixed a CSS selector bug and adjusted styles for better consistency. Integrated Formspree to enable email submissions from the contact form.
*   **Color Scheme Update:** Changed the menu text color to #F19A88. Updated the copyright year in the footer. Set the key color to #F19A88 and applied it to the "VOM" logo and all buttons for a consistent look.
